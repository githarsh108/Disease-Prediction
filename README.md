steps being performed
-- importing libraries
-- reading the dataset using pandas 
-- encoding the target values into numerical
-- splitting the data for training and testing the model
-- building the model
   -- k- fold cross validation
   -- support vector classifier
   -- gaussian naive bayes
   -- random forest classifier
-- building robust classifier by combining all models
--fitting the model on whole data and validating on the test dataset
-- creating a function that can take symptoms as input and generate predictions for disease
